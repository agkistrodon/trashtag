# #trashtag

## Background:
#trashtag: The viral social media challenge to clean up the environment, because let's be real, the environment needs cleaning. It's a world-changing act - one that not only makes the Earth a better place but also provides a better habitat for the other species that call this planet home. This game emulates the cleaning of a littered beach, in hopes that the player will go on to clean a real beach and change the real world. Read more [here](https://www.trashtag.org/).

## Instructions:
You are cleaning up a beach! Use the arrow keys to move the player and collect trash. Keep track of your score in the top right corner. If that hits 200, you win! However, there are turtles on this beach endangered by the trash. If three turtles touch trash, it's game over. Good luck!
